Toolchain For STM32F4DISCOVERY

Note : Before setting up toolchain, it is recommended to update the system.

Summor ARM Toolchain is being used, to set up toolchain , follow these :

1) Make a directory for downloading the sources : 

  $ mkdir ~/stm32f4discovery
  $ cd ~/stm32f4discovery

2) Fetch the summon arm toolchain : 

  $ git clone https://github.com/esden/summon-arm-toolchain.git
  $ cd summon-arm-toolchain
  $ ./summon-arm-toolchain 

Executing ./summon-arm-toolchain will start the configuration.

If everything goes well then the toolchain will configured and you can check the ~/sat folder in home which will contain : 
  arm-none-eabi  bin  include  lib  libexec share

~/sat/bin contains the ELF executable which are the used to compile the code written for the application.

To confirm that your toolchain is configured apart from above said ~/sat folder your script should give this as the output on the terminal before ending :

       BUILD   lib/stm32/f1
      make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
       BUILD   lib/stm32/f2
      make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
       BUILD   lib/stm32/f4
      make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
       BUILD   lib/lpc13xx
      make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
       BUILD   lib/lpc17xx
      make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all'.
       BUILD   lib/lm3s
      make[1]: Nothing to be done for `all'.

Possible Errors While Configuring Toolchain :

If after executing the ./summon-arm-toolchain the script isn't able to fetch the NEWLIB then do following :

  1) Download the NEWLIB tar in the sources and save it in sources directory :
     ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/newlib/newlib-1.19.0.tar.gz
  2) Open : $vi summon-arm-toolchain and comment the 321 line. 

This will skip NEWLIB fetching using the script, though the installation will be done by the script only by using the source you downloaded in step 1.

Now execute :

  $./summon-arm-toolchain

After resolving above error possibility is that one can get following error :

   checking for objdir... .libs
   checking for the correct version of gmp.h... yes
   checking for the correct version of mpfr.h... no
   configure: error: Building GCC requires GMP 4.2+, MPFR 2.3.1+ and MPC 0.8.0+.
   Try the --with-gmp, --with-mpfr and/or --with-mpc options to specify
   their locations.  Source code for these libraries can be found at
   their respective hosting sites as well as at
   ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/.  See also
   http://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html for additional info.  If
   you obtained GMP, MPFR and/or MPC from a vendor distribution package,
   make sure that you have installed both the libraries and the header
   files.  They may be located in separate packages.

To get rid of this, do following assuming you are in summon-arm-toolchain directory  : 

   1) Download these packages from here : http://www.multiprecision.org/index.php?prog=mpc&page=download 
   2) cd gcc-linaro-4.5-2011.02-0/ 
   3) tar -jxf ../mpfr-3.1.0.tar.bz2 
   4) mv -v mpfr-3.1.0 mpfr
   5) tar -jxf ../gmp-5.0.2.tar.bz2
   6) mv -v gmp-5.0.2 gmp
   7) tar -zxf ../mpc-0.9.tar.gz
   8) mv -v mpc-0.9 mpc

Now execute the script :

   $./summon-arm-toolchain

This error can also occur during the configuration :

   checking for creal in -lm... yes
   checking for __gmpz_init in -lgmp... yes
   checking for MPFR... no
   configure: error: libmpfr not found or uses a different ABI.
   make[1]: *** [configure-mpc] Error 1
   make[1]: Leaving directory 
    `/home/chetanpatil/LM3S9B96/stm32f4discovery_root/esden-summon-arm-   toolchain-5f14832/build'
   make: *** [all] Error 2

Do following :

   1) sudo yum install ncurses-devel
   2) sudo yum install mpfr-devel

Then run the script again:

   $./summon-arm-toolchain
